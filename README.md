# CodingInterviewPrep
## Overview
This is a repository for logging the coding interviews preps.

Problem sets based on https://programmers.co.kr/

## Log Strategy
### Branches
* This repository runs in three parts: `main`, `wip`, and _participants branches_ (Each member has their branches.)
* Every time they finalize solutions, merge theirs in `wip`.
* `wip` is merged into `main` on every weekends.
